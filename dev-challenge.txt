My project was completed with Django, the Python web framework.
The primary add on that made this project work is the Django REST Framework

Django follows it's own version of the MVC design pattern and each layer is defined in the following files:
	Model: api/models.py
	View: called Templates in Django, not built for our API
	Controller: api/views.py
	
Most of the default routing, views and serialization are provided by Django REST Framework ModelViewSet and HyperlinkedModelSerializer
I simply overrode the default behavior to match the project specifications in the areas where it was required, making for consise code that doesn't require extensive testing
